## Portfolio

Welcome to my Technical Writing Portfolio repository!

This repository is to house various technical documents that I have created. I began writing instructional documentation in 2017 and have continued to grow my skills.

I have separated my work into two folders. Technical Documents contains writing-focused documentation and Miscellaneous Documents contains documents that focus more on my ability to design.
